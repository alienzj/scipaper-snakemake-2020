\title{Supplement: Sustainable data analysis with Snakemake}
\maketitle

\section{Readability}\label{sec:readability}
Statements in Snakemake workflow definitions fall into seven categories:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item a natural language word, followed by a colon (e.g.~\lstinline!input:! and~\lstinline!output:!),
	\item the word ``rule'', followed by a name and a colon (e.g. \lstinline!rule\ convert\_to\_pdf:!),
	\item a quoted filename pattern (e.g. \lstinline!"{prefix}.pdf"!),
	\item a quoted shell command,
	\item a quoted wrapper identifier,
	\item a quoted container URL
	\item a Python statement.
\end{enumerate}

Below, we list the rationale of our assessment for each category in \autoref{m-fig:example}: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The natural language word is either understandable with general education~(e.g.\ \lstinline!input:! and \lstinline!output:!) or technical knowledge (\lstinline!container:! or~\lstinline!conda:!).
	      The colon straightforwardly shows that the content follows next.
	      Only for the wrapper directive (\lstinline!wrapper:!) one needs to have the Snakemake specific knowledge that it is possible to refer to publicly available tool wrappers.
	\item
	      The word rule is understandable with general education, and when
	      carefully choosing rule names, at most domain knowledge is needed for
	      understanding such statements.
	\item
	      Filename patterns can mostly be understood with domain knowledge,
	      since the file extensions should tell the expert what kind of content
	      will be used or created.
	      We hypothesize that wildcard definitions (e.g.~\lstinline!{country}!) are straightforwardly understandable as a placeholder.
	\item
	      Shell commands will usually need domain and technical knowledge for
	      reception.
	\item
	      Wrapper identifiers can be understood with Snakemake knowledge only,
	      since one needs to know about the central tool wrapper repository of
	      Snakemake.
	      Nevertheless, with only domain knowledge one can at least conclude that the mentioned tool (last part of the wrapper ID) will be used in the wrapper.
	\item
	      A container URL will usually be understandable with technical
	      knowledge.
	\item
	      Python statements will either need technical knowledge or Snakemake
	      knowledge (when using the Snakemake API, as it happens here with the
	      expand command, which allows to aggregate over a combination of
	      wildcard values).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Design patterns}\label{sec:design-patterns}

\autoref{fig:design-patterns} shows advanced design patterns which are less common but useful in certain situations.

\begin{figure}

	\caption{Additional design patterns for Snakemake workflows.
		For brevity only rule properties that are necessary to understand each example are shown (e.g. omitting log directives and shell commands).
		(a) scatter/gather process, (b) streaming, (c) non-file parameters, (d) sample sheet based configuration, (e) conditional execution, (f) benchmarking.
		See \autoref{sec:design-patterns} for details.

\paragraph{Scatter/gather processes (a).}
Snakemakes ability to emply arbitrary Python code for defining a rule's input and output files already enables any kind of scattering, gathering, and aggregations in workflows.
Nevertheless, it can be more readable and scalable to use Snakemake's explicit support for scatter/gather processes.
A Snakemake workflow can have any number of such processes, each of which has a name (here \lstinline!someprocess!).
In this example, the rule \lstinline!scatter! splits an data into $n$ items; the rule \lstinline!step2! is applied to each item; the rule \lstinline!gather! aggregates over the outputs of \lstinline!step2! for each item.
Thereby, $n$ is defined via the \lstinline!scattergather! directive at the beginning, which sets $n$ for each scatter/gather process in the workflow.
In addition, $n$ can be set via the command line via the flag \lstinline!--set-scatter!.
For example, here, we could set the number of scatter items to 16 by specifying \lstinline!--set-scatter someprocess=16!.

\paragraph{Streaming (b).}
Snakemake allows to stream output between jobs, instead of writing it to disk (see \autoref{m-sec:streaming} in the main document).
Here, the output of rule \lstinline!step1! and \lstinline!step2! is streamed into rule \lstinline!step3!.

\paragraph{Non-file parameters (c).}
Often, data analysis steps need additional non-file input in the form of parameters, that are for example obtained from the workflow configuration (see \autoref{m-sec:automation} in the main document).
Both input files and such non-file parameters can optionally be defined via a Python function, which is evaluated for each job, when wildcard values are known.
In this example, we define a lambda expression (an anonymous function in Python), that retrieves a threshold depending on the value of the wildcard sample (\lstinline!w.sample!).
Wildcard values are passed as the first positional argument to such functions (here \lstinline!w!).

\paragraph{Sample sheet based configuration (d).}
Often, scientific experiments entail multiple samples, for which meta-information is known (e.g. gender, tissue etc. in biomedicine).
Portable encapsulated projects (PEPs, \url{https://pep.databio.org}) are an approach to standardize such information and provide them in a shareable format.
Snakemake workflows can be directly integrated with PEPs, thereby allowing to configure them via meta-information that is contained in the sample sheets defined by the PEP.
Here, a pepfile is defined, followed by an aggregation over all samples defined in the contained sample sheet.

\paragraph{Conditional execution (e).}
