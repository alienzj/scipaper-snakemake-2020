Whether you are a student, software developer, tech entrepreneur, or researcher in computer science, this authoritative and self-contained book tells you everything you need to know about the new global money for the Internet age.How do Bitcoin and its block chain actually work? How secure are your bitcoins? How anonymous are their users? Can cryptocurrencies be regulated? These are some of the many questions this book answers. It begins by tracing the history and development of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and then gives the conceptual and practical foundations you need to engineer secure software that interacts with the Bitcoin network as well as to integrate ideas from Bitcoin into your own projects. Topics include decentralization, mining, the politics of Bitcoin, altcoins and the cryptocurrency ecosystem, the future of Bitcoin, and more.An essential introduction to the new technologies of digital currencyCovers the history and mechanics of Bitcoin and the block chain, security, decentralization, anonymity, politics and regulation, altcoins, and much moreFeatures an accompanying website that includes instructional videos for each chapter, homework problems, programming assignments, and lecture slidesAlso suitable for use with the authors' Coursera online courseElectronic solutions manual (available only to professors)},

The second chapter of Readability Revisited presents the new, revised Dale-Chall Readability Formula which is based on a new set of criterion passages, an updated familiar word list, and better rules for measuring the two factors of word familiarity and sentence length. The authors have also simplified the instructions and computations required to apply the formula. Three worksheets included in the book combine the revised Dale-Chall formula with assessments of the cognitive and structural elements of the written material, the characteristics of the target readers, and their purpose for reading the material. Together, these provide a new and powerful tool for assessing the reading difficulty of written materials.},
